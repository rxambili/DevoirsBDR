Expose randomChar as a built-in helper, eg: {{char 'ABCDEF'}}
	Not as helpful as regex, but could point to alternatives in the readme


Store last generated values on the root data object - useful for other helpers to access
  eg: options.data.root.__firstName


Alternative way to supply custom arrays of mock data:

  dummyjson.parse(string, {
    lists: {
      size: ['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL']
    }
  });

Would need to ensure that these custom lists can override the defaults, like firstNames, lastNames, etc
